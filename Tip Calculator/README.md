## Notes

There are two challenges that I encountered while building the app. Firstly, Swift is a new language to me and I had to learn the new language's syntax. Secondly, Xcode is also a new IDE for me and it took
me a few hours to get familiar with its usages. Overall, it was a really challenging and fun experience while building out the app.
